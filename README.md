- The `.env` file should contain the following variables:
  - `VITE_ENVIRONMENT`: `DEV` or `PROD`
  - `VITE_FIREBASE_APIKEY`: The API key for the Firebase project.
  - `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTHDOMAIN`: The auth domain for the Firebase project.
  - `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECTID`: The project ID for the Firebase project.
  - `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGEBUCKET`: The storage bucket for the Firebase project.
  - `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGINGSENDERID`: The messaging sender ID for the Firebase project.
  - `VITE_FIREBASE_APPID`: The app ID for the Firebase project.

  - `VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASEURL`: The database URL for the Firebase project.
  - `VITE_QR_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the QR code generation ([ip]/play/).

### Hosting a Game

- Navigate to the host interface and create a quiz by combining different slide types.
- Save the game as a reusable template for future sessions.

### Player Interaction

- Players can join the game room using a unique code and interact through an intuitive interface.

### Adding New Features

- To add a new question type or slide type, add the type declaration to /src/models/Quiz.ts
- Create a new directory in /src/slides/[slide-type]
- In the new directory create the following files:
  - Preview.tsx: Renders the slide in the quiz editor.
  - Host.tsx: Renders the slide for the host.
  - Participant.tsx: Renders the slide for participants.
  - ParticipantAnswer.tsx: Renders the slide showing if the participant was correct/incorrect, awarded score etc.
  - Toolbar.tsx: Renders the form for editing the slide in the toolbar.
  - index.ts: Exports the slide components and metadata.
    - Define the slide metadata using the SlideInfo type.
      - `value` should be the same as the directory name.
      - `icon` should be a LucideIcon component.
      - `label` should be the same as the directory name.
      - `slideType` should be the same as the directory name.
      - `questionType` is only needed for question slides.
      - `defaults` should be the default values for the slide when it is created.
- In /src/slides/index.ts
  - Import and export the new slide type
- In /src/slides/utils.ts
  - Modify getSlideComponents to return the new slide type

### Adding New Languages

Follow these steps to add a new language to the application:

#### 1. Create the Language Files

1. Navigate to the directory: `Zap/public/locales`.
2. Create a new folder named after the **language code**. Use standard [ISO 639-1] language codes.
3. Inside the new folder, add the corresponding translation files. Use the existing folders (e.g., `en` or `sv`) as references for structure and content.

#### 2. Add the Language Name to `general.json` Files

1. Open the `general.json` file for each existing language folder (e.g., `Zap/public/locales/en/general.json`, `Zap/public/locales/sv/general.json`).
2. Add a new translation entry for the new language. For example, in the `en` `general.json` you would add:
   ```json
   {
     "{New_Language}": "{New_Language_In_English}"
   }
   ```

#### 3. Add the Language to the Config File

1. Open the file `Zap/src/config/languages.ts`
2. Add a new entry in the following way:

```ts
  {
     name: 'general:{NEW_LANGUAGE}',
     value: '{LANGUAGE_CODE}',
   },
```
