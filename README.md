## Developer Documentation

### Hosting a Game
- Navigate to the host interface and create a quiz by combining different slide types.
- Save the game as a reusable template for future sessions.

### Player Interaction
- Players can join the game room using a unique code and interact through an intuitive interface.

### Adding New Features
- To add a new question type or slide type, add the type declaration to /src/models/Quiz.ts
- Create a new directory in /src/slides/[slide-type]
- In the new directory create the following files:
   - Preview.tsx: Renders the slide in the quiz editor.
   - Host.tsx: Renders the slide for the host.
   - Participant.tsx: Renders the slide for participants.
   - ParticipantAnswer.tsx: Renders the slide showing if the participant was correct/incorrect, awarded score etc.
   - Toolbar.tsx: Renders the form for editing the slide in the toolbar.
   - index.ts: Exports the slide components and metadata.
      - Define the slide metadata using the SlideInfo type.
         - `value` should be the same as the directory name.
         - `icon` should be a LucideIcon component.
         - `label` should be the same as the directory name.
         - `slideType` should be the same as the directory name.
         - `questionType` is only needed for question slides.
         - `defaults` should be the default values for the slide when it is created.
- In /src/slides/index.ts
  - Import and export the new slide type
- In /src/slides/utils.ts
  - Modify getSlideComponents to return the new slide type
